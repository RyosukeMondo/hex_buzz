## Tips and Strategies

### General Tips

1. **Look Before You Tap**: Plan your path before committing to moves
2. **Start from Corners**: Corner cells often have limited connection options

4. **Use Undo Freely**: Don't hesitate to step back and try different approaches
5. **Think Ahead**: Consider how each move affects future options

### Advanced Strategies

- **Work Backwards**: Sometimes it helps to identify the end cell first
- **Identify Bottlenecks**: Look for cells that must be visited in a specific order
- **Pattern Recognition**: Similar grid shapes often have similar solutions
- **Practice Makes Perfect**: The more you play, the better you'll recognize patterns
