The MVP focuses on core gameplay mechanics with AI Agent-first development approach, deferring advanced features like leaderboards, cloud sync, and elaborate visual effects to future iterations.\n\n**MVP Scope**:\n- Single playable level (hardcoded or simple generation)\n- Core one-stroke drawing mechanics\n- Basic visual feedback\n- CLI/REST API for AI agent development\n- Web platform only (for rapid iteration)\n\n**Deferred to Post-MVP**:\n- Multiple levels / level progression\n- Level generation algorithm\n- Pachinko-style celebration effects\n- Sound effects\n- Mobile/desktop platforms\n- Leaderboard / cloud storage\n- Settings screen\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis MVP supports the product vision by:\n1. **AI Agent-First Development**: Prioritizing CLI/REST API before UI, enabling autonomous AI development\n2. **Simplicity First**: Starting with minimal features to validate core gameplay\n3. **Cross-Platform Foundation**: Using Flutter/Web as base for future platform expansion\n\n## Requirements\n\n### REQ-001: Hexagonal Grid Display\n\n**User Story:** As a player, I want to see a hexagonal grid on screen, so that I can understand the puzzle layout.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the game screen loads THEN the system SHALL display a honeycomb grid of hexagonal cells\n2. WHEN the grid is displayed THEN each cell SHALL be visually distinct with clear boundaries\n3. WHEN the grid is displayed THEN the grid size SHALL be configurable (default: 4x4 for MVP)\n\n---\n\n### REQ-002: Checkpoint Display\n\n**User Story:** As a player, I want to see numbered checkpoints on the grid, so that I know the required path order.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the level loads THEN the system SHALL display numbered checkpoints (01, 02, 03...) on designated cells\n2. WHEN checkpoints are displayed THEN the starting checkpoint (lowest number) SHALL be visually highlighted\n3. WHEN checkpoints are displayed THEN the ending checkpoint (highest number) SHALL be visually distinct from intermediate checkpoints\n\n---\n\n### REQ-003: Path Drawing via Touch/Mouse\n\n**User Story:** As a player, I want to draw a path by dragging my finger or mouse, so that I can solve the puzzle.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the player starts dragging from the starting checkpoint THEN the system SHALL begin recording the path\n2. WHEN the player drags to an adjacent cell THEN the system SHALL extend the path to that cell\n3. WHEN the player drags THEN the system SHALL display the current path visually\n4. WHEN the path is being drawn THEN the system SHALL show a color gradient based on path length (simple color transition)\n\n---\n\n### REQ-004: Path Validation\n\n**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to prevent invalid moves, so that I don't accidentally break the rules.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the player attempts to move to a non-adjacent cell THEN the system SHALL ignore the input\n2. WHEN the player attempts to move to an already-visited cell THEN the system SHALL ignore the input\n3. WHEN the player reaches an intermediate checkpoint out of order THEN the system SHALL prevent further progress past that point\n4. IF the player is not currently at a checkpoint THEN the system SHALL allow free movement to any unvisited adjacent cell\n\n---\n\n### REQ-005: Path Undo (Backtracking)\n\n**User Story:** As a player, I want to undo my path by backtracking, so that I can correct mistakes without resetting.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the player drags back along the drawn path THEN the system SHALL remove the backtracked segments\n2. WHEN backtracking THEN the system SHALL update the visual path in real-time\n3. WHEN the player backtracks to the starting checkpoint THEN the system SHALL clear the entire path\n\n---\n\n### REQ-006: Level Reset\n\n**User Story:** As a player, I want to reset the current level, so that I can start over when stuck.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the player activates the reset function THEN the system SHALL clear all drawn paths\n2. WHEN the level resets THEN the system SHALL restore all cells to their initial state\n3. WHEN the level resets THEN the system SHALL NOT require confirmation (immediate reset)\n\n---\n\n### REQ-007: Win Condition Detection\n\n**User Story:** As a player, I want to know when I've completed the puzzle, so that I feel accomplished.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the player reaches the final checkpoint AND all cells are visited AND all checkpoints were visited in order THEN the system SHALL detect a win condition\n2. WHEN win is detected THEN the system SHALL display a simple success indicator (e.g., color flash, \"Complete!\" text)\n3. WHEN win is detected THEN the system SHALL record the completion time\n\n---\n\n### REQ-008: REST API for Game State (AI Agent Support)\n\n**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to query and control the game via REST API, so that I can develop and test autonomously.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/game/state` THEN the system SHALL return the current game state as JSON\n2. WHEN a POST request is made to `/api/game/move` with a target cell THEN the system SHALL execute the move if valid\n3. WHEN a POST request is made to `/api/game/reset` THEN the system SHALL reset the current level\n4. WHEN an invalid move is attempted via API THEN the system SHALL return an error response with reason\n\n---\n\n### REQ-009: CLI for Level Validation (AI Agent Support)\n\n**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to validate levels via CLI, so that I can verify puzzle solvability.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the CLI is invoked with `validate` command and a level definition THEN the system SHALL check if the level is solvable\n2. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL output the result as structured JSON\n3. WHEN the level is solvable THEN the system SHALL optionally output a solution path\n\n---\n\n### REQ-010: Structured Logging\n\n**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want structured logs, so that I can analyze game behavior autonomously.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN any game event occurs THEN the system SHALL log it in JSON format\n2. WHEN logging THEN each log entry SHALL include: timestamp, level, component, event, context\n3. WHEN the game runs THEN logs SHALL be accessible via stdout or log file\n\n---\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each file has one clear purpose\n- **Modular Design**: Domain logic completely independent of UI (testable with pure Dart)\n- **Dependency Management**: Follow module boundaries defined in structure.md\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Domain layer exposes clean service interfaces\n\n### Performance\n- 60 FPS minimum during path drawing\n- < 100ms response time for move validation\n- < 2 seconds initial load time on web\n\n### Security\n- No sensitive data handling in MVP\n- API endpoints accessible only in debug mode\n\n### Reliability\n- Game state recoverable after page refresh (local storage)\n- No data loss on unexpected closure\n\n### Usability\n- No text instructions needed - gameplay self-explanatory\n- Touch-friendly hit areas for hexagonal cells\n- Clear visual distinction between visited/unvisited cells\n",
