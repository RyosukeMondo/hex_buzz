The game challenges players to draw a single continuous path from a starting checkpoint to an ending checkpoint while covering every cell in the grid exactly once.\n\n## Target Users\n- **Primary**: Casual puzzle game players of all ages (children to adults)\n- **Secondary**: Players seeking brain-training or relaxation games\n- **Pain Points Addressed**:\n  - Need for quick, satisfying puzzle experiences\n  - Desire for games that are easy to learn but progressively challenging\n  - Want for visually appealing, stress-free gaming experiences\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Honeycomb Grid Gameplay**: Navigate hexagonal grids with numbered checkpoints (01, 02, 03...) that must be visited in order while covering all cells\n2. **Progressive Difficulty**: Grid sizes from 4x4 (tutorial) to 16x16 (expert), with optimized checkpoint counts for each level\n3. **Visual Path Effects**: Dynamic color-changing path visualization as the stroke lengthens\n4. **Celebration Animations**: Pachinko/slot-machine style visual effects on level completion (toggleable)\n5. **Undo/Reset Functionality**: Backtrack by retracing path; full reset available anytime\n6. **Cross-Platform Play**: Available on Web, Android, iOS, Linux, and Windows\n\n## Business Objectives\n\n- Provide a free, ad-supported casual gaming experience\n- Build user engagement through progressively challenging levels\n- Establish foundation for future global leaderboard feature\n- Create a visually distinctive puzzle game brand\n\n## Development Philosophy: AI Agent-First\n\n**Goal**: Achieve extremely high developer experience through fully autonomous AI Agent development.\n\n### Core Principles\n1. **CLI/REST API First**: Build all features with CLI and REST API interfaces before UI, enabling AI agents to interact, test, and debug programmatically\n2. **Comprehensive Logging**: Implement structured logging throughout the application so AI agents can analyze behavior and diagnose issues autonomously\n3. **Autonomous Feedback Loop**: AI agents should be able to:\n   - Run tests and receive structured results\n   - Query game state via REST API\n   - Validate level generation algorithms via CLI\n   - Get immediate feedback without human intervention\n\n### Development Priority Order\nWhen implementing any feature:\n1. **First**: Build CLI/REST API debug capabilities\n2. **Second**: Add comprehensive logging and error reporting\n3. **Third**: Enable AI agent autonomous testing and validation\n4. **Fourth**: Implement UI/visual components\n5. **Last Resort**: Ask human developer only for decisions truly requiring human judgment\n\n### Benefits\n- Faster iteration cycles through autonomous AI development\n- Reduced context-switching for human developers\n- Self-documenting codebase through API-first design\n- Easier debugging and maintenance\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- **User Retention**: 30-day retention rate target\n- **Session Length**: Average time spent per session\n- **Level Completion**: Percentage of users completing each difficulty tier\n- **Cross-Platform Adoption**: Distribution of users across platforms\n\n## Product Principles\n\n1. **Simplicity First**: No text-based tutorials needed; gameplay should be self-explanatory through visual design\n2. **Frustration-Free**: System prevents invalid moves automatically; users cannot make mistakes that require restart\n3. **Universal Accessibility**: No localization needed - pure visual/icon-based UI works across all languages\n4. **Performance Priority**: Smooth experience on low-spec devices; visual effects are optional\n\n## Monitoring & Visibility\n\n- **Dashboard Type**: In-game level select screen with completion status\n- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate visual feedback during gameplay (path drawing, checkpoints)\n- **Key Metrics Displayed**: Best completion time per level, current level progress\n- **Sharing Capabilities**: Future leaderboard integration for global rankings\n\n## Future Vision\n\n### Potential Enhancements\n- **Global Leaderboard**: Compare completion times with players worldwide (cloud-based)\n- **Daily Challenges**: Procedurally generated daily puzzles\n- **Achievement System**: Unlock badges for completing levels within time targets\n- **Social Features**: Share completed paths, challenge friends\n",
